# Print Text Slow

This is a stupid program that I originally wrote in C and now re-written in Rust.

It takes a file as argument and prints its content into the console and every 20 line the program pause for a minute and prints a thought. Two lists of thoughts/phrases and answers are loaded and could be extended of desired.

Overall, this program is pure entertainment and a excuse for me to write more Rust.
